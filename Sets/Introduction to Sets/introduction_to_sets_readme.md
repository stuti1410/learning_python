A set is a collection of elements that are:
* **Unordered:** The order of elements in a set is arbitrary, and when printed, iterated, or converted into a sequence, the elements appear in no specific order.
* **Unique:** A set cannot contain duplicate elements. If duplicates are added, they are automatically removed.

# Problem Overview
Ms. Gabriel Williams, a botany professor, asked Mickey to compute the average of all the plants with distinct heights in her greenhouse.
The task is to calculate the average height, ensuring no duplicate heights are counted.

**Input**
* The first line contains an integer N (the number of plant heights).
* The second line contains N space-separated integers representing the heights of the plants.
