To print the decimal, octal, hexadecimal, and binary representations of a number, use the built-in functions `oct()`, `hex()`, and `bin()` for octal, hexadecimal, and binary respectively.

The `[2:]` is **Slice Notation**. It is used to extract a portion of a string.
The slicing syntax is: `string[start_position:end_position]`
For example, `hex(255)` Returns `0xff` and `hex(255)[2:]` Returns `ff`.

`.upper()` converts the remaining hexadecimal digits to uppercase.

`.rjust()`, `.ljust()`, and `.center()` are used for adjusting the characters as right justified, left justified and center respectively.
