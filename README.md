# learning_python

Welcome to my **Learning Python** repository. This repository is a collection of notes, exercises, concepts, and programs created while learning python. It includes various topics ranging from basic syntax to more advanced concepts. The objective of this repository is to document my learning journey and to have a reference for future projects and studies.

Each program is housed in its own folder, which contains:
* The Python script that implements the program.
* A `README.md` file that explains the program, key concepts, and any useful tips or tricks I encountered while working on it.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organised as follows:
learning_python/
├── Sets/
│   ├── Program 1/
│        ├── program1.py
│        └── README.md
│   ├── Program 2/
│        ├── program2.py
│        └── README.md
├── String Manipulation
│   ├── Program 1/
│       ├── program1.py
│       └── README.md
│   ├── Program 2/
│        ├── program2.py
│        └── README.md
└── ...

Each folder contains:

**Python File** (`.py`): The code for the program.
**README.md**: An explanation of how the program works, any new concepts learned, and any helpful insights or tips.

## Topics Covered
