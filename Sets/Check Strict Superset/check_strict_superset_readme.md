## Problem Overview
The goal is to print `True` if set A is strict superset of all other N sets. Otherwise, print `False`.<br>
A strict superset has at least one element that does not exist in its subset.<br>

**Sample Input**

The first line contains the space separated elements of set A.<br>
The second line contains integer n, the number of other sets.<br>
The next n lines contains the space separated elements of the other sets.<br>
